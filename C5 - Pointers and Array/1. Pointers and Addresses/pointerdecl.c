    /*
     printf("%s\n", s) -> "HI!" | prints the string pointed to by s, character-by-character until
     s is a pointer to string
     s is a char* unlike s* which is a char
     Start at the memory address s, and print characters until you hit the null terminator ('\0').
     In C, strings are just pointers to the first character.
     C relies on '\0' â€” to know when to stop printing.
